                <div>     My name is Jayden Szakmary, I've been interested in programming for a long time 
                    but havent had the means to take time to learn enough to switch professions. I have 
                    two amazing sons, Victor (3), and Maximilian (1) and have been married for 5 years. 
                    Last February I moved to Dallas, Texas where I own a home with my partner but i was born
                    and raised in Denver, Colorado. I'm an animal lover as you can see by the many cages behind me in my office. 
                    I have 4 tarantulas, 2 scorpions, a bearded dragon, green basilisk, a banana colored ball python and a colony of dubia roaches!

                <div>My career for the past two years has been inspecting, servicing, and installing commercial fire alarms. Pictured above is about the biggest project I've had 
                    the pleasure of doing, it's a VESDA system which essentially samples air from those orange tubes over a protected space and can detect extremely small amounts of obscuration.
                    Being a fire alarm technician is alot like being an electrician, the main difference being what I did was highly specialized and generally harder to get into. Over two years I've gathered many 
                    different certifications and licenses such as, NICET II, F.A.L. for Texas, Denver journeyman, and EST IO programmers cert. and many more although those are the important ones. 
                    Although I loved what I was doing my real passion has always been computers and everything they entail. Most recently I taking college classes in my free time but realized I needed a much more 
                    direct approach. So rather than going to school for 4+ years I decided to quit my job and join a coding bootcamp!

                <div>Herein lies my real love for computers, video games. What you're looking at here is a graph of gold, in League of Legends, accumulated between both teams(I was red team) where blue was dominating us. After some risky 
                    plays and technical maneuvers we were able to swing the advantage our way and win the game. Video games have always been the main source of entertainment for me as far back as I can remember.
                    I still remember getting my first console when I was just a kid and ever since then I've had a mostly healthy obsession. I enjoy all types of video games but MOBA's, and MMO's are my two favorite types
                    by far. But any game I can spend hours playing with friends is definetly worth playing!
